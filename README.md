## About The CSS3 Fundamentals Course
**Cascading Style Sheets**, most commonly known as **CSS**, is the code that styles your web content. CSS is used to describe the presentation of web pages, including colours, layouts, and fonts. It is used to define styles for design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 
This is, therefore, an essential part of Web Development.
Like HTML this is not a programming language, and it’s not a markup language either. **CSS is a style sheet language**, which means that it is used to express the presentation of structured documents. In fact, CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. It’s a must-have skill for anyone wanting to develop a career as a web developer or a web designer. If that’s you, then you are at the right place, welcome!

- ✅ How to style your content
